# World Weather Analysis

### Project Status:
completed

## Project Intro/Objective
Using Python and the Pandas library, create a marker layer map, and a directions layer Google map that shows directions to travel between multiple cities. And test the knowledge of decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenWeather API 
- Google Maps API

## Project Description 
In this project I've generated 1500 random longitude-latitude pairs to further use in an API call and get a list of cities with the coresponding coordinates. To further transform them into several DataFrames. Filtered them based on input and nested decision statements, and logical expressions. I created pop-up markers on a Google map from a filtered DataFrame.
Added a directions layer on a Google map between cities in the filtered DataFrame. Performed linear regression, and add regression lines to scatter plots.
