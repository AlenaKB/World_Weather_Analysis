# World_Weather_Analysis

Using Python and the Pandas library to create a marker layer map, and a directions layer Google map that shows directions to travel between multiple cities.

The goals for this challenge are to:

Use nested try-except blocks.
Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
Create a new DataFrame from a new API search with new weather parameters.
Filter DataFrames based on input and nested decision statements, and logical expressions.
Create pop-up markers on a Google map from a filtered DataFrame.
Add a directions layer on a Google map between cities in the filtered DataFrame.
